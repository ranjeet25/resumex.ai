### Resume scanning based on a given job description is a valuable feature offered by resume scanners. It helps streamline the candidate screening process by automatically identifying resumes that closely match the requirements of a specific job.

## Some Features 👇  

 1. <b>Job Description Analysis:</b> The resume scanner analyzes the content and keywords within the job description provided by the employer. It identifies the essential skills, qualifications, experience, and other relevant criteria for the job.
  
 2. <b>Keyword Matching:</b> The scanner compares the keywords and phrases from the job description with the content of each resume. It identifies resumes that contain the specified keywords, indicating a potential match between the candidate's qualifications and the job requirements.
    
 3. <b>Relevance Scoring:</b> The scanner assigns a relevance score to each resume based on the extent of keyword matching and the importance of the matched keywords in the job description. Resumes with a higher score indicate a closer alignment with the job requirements.
